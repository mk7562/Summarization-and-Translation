# Summarization-and-Translation


In the age of YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, where attention
spans are shorter, our work represents a small yet impactful effort to
enhance people's lives on a large scale. We strive to ensure that no
crucial information escapes their attention.


This project intends to use Natural Language Processing(NLP)algorithm for summarization and translation to provide solution in an era of abundance for textual information.This
project explores the fusion of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
algorithms to address this challenge by developing a robust
system capable of summarizing and translating text content
seamlessly.


CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE INDIVIDUAL TEAM MEMBERS:
Manish Kumar(21bds036)
I did study and run the models Bert,GPT2,pegasus.Ananlysed what the summary they have generated,evaluated using roughe score and plotted a visual graph using matplotlib.

Ravi Ranjan(21bds057)
I did run the abstractive models like T5 and Bart,as well as combined model by all four abstractive models(GPT2,Pegasus,T5,bart) ..

N Dillibabu(21bs042)
I have run the model for the multilanguage translation-MBart,which is by Facebook and analysed the result generated by it.

Kiriti Kumar Kola(21bds028)
I installed the summarizer and imported the dataset on which our project is performed.
